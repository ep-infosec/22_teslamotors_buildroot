	  SQLite is a small C library that implements a
	  self-contained, embeddable, zero-configuration SQL database
	  engine.

config BR2_PACKAGE_SQLITE_MAX_PAGE_COUNT
	bool "Maximum database size (in 1KB pages)"
	default 1073741823
	help
	  SQLite is able to limit the size of a database file to prevent
	  the database file from growing too large and consuming too
	  much disk space. The SQLITE_MAX_PAGE_COUNT parameter, which
	  is normally set to 1073741823, is the maximum number of pages
	  allowed in a single database file. An attempt to insert new
	  data that would cause the database file to grow larger than
	  this will return SQLITE_FULL.

	  The largest possible setting for SQLITE_MAX_PAGE_COUNT is
	  2147483646. When used with the maximum page size of 65536, this
	  gives a maximum SQLite database size of about 140 terabytes.

config BR2_PACKAGE_SQLITE_RTREE
	bool "Enable SQLite R*Tree module"
	default n
	help
	  An R-Tree is a special index that is designed for doing range
	  queries. R-Trees are most commonly used in geospatial systems
	  where each entry is a rectangle with minimum and maximum X
	  and Y coordinates.

config BR2_PACKAGE_SQLITE_MEMSYS5
	bool "Include memsys5 allocator in build"
	default n
	help
	  When SQLite is compiled with the SQLITE_ENABLE_MEMSYS5 option,
	  an alternative memory allocator that does not use malloc()
	  is included in the build.

	  The memsys5 allocator is designed for use on embedded systems,
	  though there is nothing to prevent its use on workstations.

config BR2_PACKAGE_SQLITE_STAT3
	bool "Additional query optimizations (stat3)"
	help
	  Adds additional logic to the ANALYZE command and to the
	  query planner that can help SQLite to choose a better query
	  plan under certain situations.

config BR2_PACKAGE_SQLITE_ENABLE_COLUMN_METADATA
	bool "Enable convenient access to meta-data about tables and queries"
	help
	  When this option is defined there are some additional APIs
	  enabled to acces meta-data about tables and queries (see
	  https://sqlite.org/compile.html).

config BR2_PACKAGE_SQLITE_ENABLE_FTS3
	bool "Enable version 3 of the full-text search engine"
	help
	  When this option is defined in the amalgamation (see
	  http://www.sqlite.org/amalgamation.html), version 3 of the
	  full-text search engine is added to the build automatically.

config BR2_PACKAGE_SQLITE_ENABLE_JSON1
	bool "Enable the JSON extensions for SQLite"
	help
	  When this option is defined in the amalgamation, the JSON
	  extensions are added to the build automatically.

config BR2_PACKAGE_SQLITE_ENABLE_UNLOCK_NOTIFY
	bool "Enable sqlite3_unlock_notify() interface"
	help
	  This option enables the sqlite3_unlock_notify() interface
	  and its accosiated functionality. See the documentation
	  http://www.sqlite.org/unlock_notify.html for additional
	  information.

config BR2_PACKAGE_SQLITE_SECURE_DELETE
	bool "Set the secure_delete pragma on by default"
	help
	  This compile-time option changes the default settings of the
	  secure_delete pragma. When this option is not used,
	  secure_delete defaults to off. When this option is present,
	  secure_delete defaults to on.

	  The secure_delete setting causes deleted content to be
	  overwritten with zeros. There is a small performance penalty
	  for this since additional I/O must occur. On the other hand,
	  secure_delete can prevent sensitive information from
	  lingering in unused parts of the database file after it has
	  allegedly been deleted. See the documentation on the
	  http://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_secure_delete for
	  additional information.

config BR2_PACKAGE_SQLITE_NO_SYNC
	bool "Disable fsync"
	help
	  By default SQLite forces all database transactions to
	  storage immediately using fsync() to protect against data
	  loss in case of power failure. This option turns this
	  behavior off resulting in higher performance especially when
	  using slow flash storage.
